- Add command-line options (at isolinux bootup) to select the
  bitdepth for the X configuration
- Persistent home (This is now easier since we do partition
  detection in hwdetect - as part of this we should check for
  a livecd file on the disk and mount at the correct place)
- Install to HDD. This is possible now that the LiveCD is a direct
  copy of a MDK image insted of a hacked-up version to fit on a
  MiniCD
- Add profiles to allow for build of various types of CD's, eg.
  minicd
- Cleanup of mklivecd script (some functions exists, creation of
  initrd is a good canidate)
- Localisation support
- Remove functions in hwdetect where we have duplicated already
  existing MDK functions, e.g. in module loading
