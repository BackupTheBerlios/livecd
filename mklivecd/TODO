- Add command-line options (at isolinux bootup) to select the
  screen size and bitdepth for the X configuration 
- Persistent home
- Install to HDD. This is possible now that the LiveCD is a direct
  copy of a MDK image insted of a hacked-up version to fit on a
  MiniCD
- Add profiles to allow for build of various types of CD's, eg.
  minicd
- Cleanup of mklivecd script (some functions exists, creation of
  initrd is a good canidate)
- There is no boot.msg or help.msg to display in isolinux boot
- We don't have a splash page, possbily modify the default 9.2
  background or the normal lilo screen (Rather detect and use the
  configs in /etc/bootsplash, either way we need bootsplash
  support)
- memtest option in isolinux.cfg does not exist (we need to copy
  the correct image to provide this option)
- We should detect swap partitions and add them to fstab to allow
  them to be swapon'ed in the bootup sequence (This implies HDD
  detection code which should be re-used in the persistent home
  option)
- Localisation support
- Support for splash images on the isolinux screen
