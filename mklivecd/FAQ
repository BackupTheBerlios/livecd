Q: How do I create a tiny (truly minimal) bootable Mandrake
   LiveCD?
A: Here is a step by step process of creating your own Mandrake
   installation and creating a LiveCD image from it. (You can
   customise the process by adding additional packages, but the
   underlying concepts should stay the same)

   1. Login as root, using "su -c"
   2. Create a base directory to hold the minimal installation:
      "mkdir -p /tmp/minimal"
   3. Install the Mandrake base system,
      "urpmi basesystem devfsd harddrake --root /tmp/minimal"
   4. Issue a chroot to enter the installation image:
      "chroot /tmp/minimal"
   5. Enable shadow passwords by issuing "pwconv"
   6. Set your root password with "passwd" and follow the prompts
   7. Exit the chroot image with the "exit" command
   8. Create a LiveCD image from the minimal installation:
      "mklivecd --rootdir /tmp/minimal minimal.iso"
   9. Burn the resulting minimal.iso to CD-R and enjoy :)


Q: How much does the default compression algorithm compress the
   actual LiveCD root?
A: Exact figures differ from installation to installation, but as
   a thumb-suck, you can work on a compression ratio of 40%, i.e.
   a 1GB initial filesystem _should_ compress to 400MB.


Q: Can I adjust the compression parameters for either a faster
   LiveCD or a smaller one?
A: Indeed. The LiveCD creation script has two options, --blocksize
   and --looptype that allows you to adjust the behaviour of the
   compression algorithm (--blocksize, default 64K) and the type
   of compression used (--looptype, default cloop).

   Some testes have beed done of the effect of these options on
   both and speed, use your own judgement to see what is best for
   your particular application. (All tests were done with an
   uncompressed Knoppix v3.3 image.)

   The following table lists the descriptions of the images that
   were used in these tests. 'Compression' is the type of
   compression (none = uncompressed, cloop = cloop.o, bzloop =
   bzloop.o) and 'Block' is the blocksize passed to the various
   create compressed fs commands:

   Compression,   Block, Name:
   ------------------------------------------
          none,    none, knoppix.iso
         cloop,     64K, knoppix.iso.clp-64
         cloop,    224K, knoppix.iso.clp-224
        bzloop,     64K, knoppix.iso.bzlp-64
        bzloop,    224K, knoppix.iso.bzlp-224

   This table lists the sizes of the files on disk. 'Size' is
   the actual size as reported by the "du -k" command. 'Ratio'
   is calculated with size/uncompressed_size*100:

          Size,   Ratio, Name:
   ------------------------------------------
    1,871,360K, 100.00%, knoppix.iso
      708,656K,  37.87%, knoppix.iso.clp-64
      698,124K,  37.31%, knoppix.iso.clp-224
      684,404K,  36.57%, knoppix.iso.bzlp-64
      655,068K,  35.00%, knoppix.iso.bzlp-224

   This following table lists some timings for performing a
   (hopefully) expensive I/O operation on the mounted image.
   'Time' is the time taken for the "insmod, mount, ls -alR,
   tar -cf, umount, rmmod" and 'Ratio' is calculated with
   time/uncompressed_time*100.

          Time,   Ratio, Name:
   ------------------------------------------
           31s, 100.00%, knoppix.iso
           38s, 122.58%, knoppix.iso.clp-64
           43s, 138.71%, knoppix.iso.clp-224
           49s, 158.06%, knoppix.iso.bzlp-64
           73s, 235.48%, knoppix.iso.bzlp-224


Q: How do I change my keyboard layout?
A: By default the script installs a keyboard layout for en_US.
   You can change this behaviour in two ways:

   1. On bootup, specify "livecd keyb=<language>" at the isolinux
      prompt. For instance, "livecd keyb=en_UK" will select the
      keyboard layout as used in the UK.
   2. If you are building a specific CD which should cater for a
      specific layout, you can edit the DEF_KEYBOARD value in the
      mklivecd Makefile.
