Q: How do I create a tiny (truly minimal) bootable Mandrake LiveCD?
A: Here is a step by step process of creating your own Mandrake installation
   and creating a LiveCD image from it. (You can customise the process by
   adding additional packages, but the underlying concepts should stay the same)

   1. Login as root, using "su -c" and entering your root password
   2. Create a base directory that is to hold the minimal installation:
      "mkdir -p /root/tmp/minimal"
   3. Install the Mandrake base system,
      "urpmi basesystem devfsd harddrake --root /root/tmp/minimal"
   4. Issue a chroot to enter the installation image:
      "chroot /root/tmp/minimal"
   5. Enable shadow passwords by issuing "pwconv"
   6. Set your root password with "passwd" and follow the prompts
   7. Exit the chroot image with the "exit" command
   8. Create a LiveCD image from the minimal installation:
      "mklivecd --rootdir /root/tmp/minimal minimal.iso"
   9. Burn the 52MB minimal.iso to CD-R and enjoy :)

   
Q: How much does the compression algorithm compress the actual LiveCD root?
A: Exact figures differ from installation to installation, but as a thumb-suck,
   you can work on a compression ratio of 40%, i.e. a 1GB initial filesystem
   _should_ compress to 400MB.
