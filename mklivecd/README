The latest version of the package can alway be found at the following URL:

    http://www.linuxminicd.org/mklivecd/

The package naming tries to follow the Linux kernel approach to versioning, i.e.
versions are in the format "major.minor.patch" where an uneven minor version
number indicates an unstable and/or testing release.

There is a mailing list available for discussion of the mklivecd scripts and
associated programs. More information on this list, including subscription
details can be found at:

     http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/minicd-scripts

Patches, suggestions, flames and general comments are always welcome at the
above adress. Good luck!
