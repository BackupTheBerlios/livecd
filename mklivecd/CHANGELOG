* Thu, Sep 25, 2003 Jaco Greeff <jaco@linuxminicd.org> 0.5.5
- Changed input blocksize to compression in mklivecd from 64K to 224K. This
  still allows for overflow blocks (i.e. block with no compression) to be
  smaller than the maximum size of 256K, whilst allowing for a smaller final
  iso size (It can be made larger, but 224K is safe and should work for all
  types of blocks)
- Added support for bzloop images (experimental) in both mklivecd and
  the linuxrc scripts (--looptype=<cloop|bzloop> option to mklivecd). This
  (--looptype=bzloop) requires an updated cloop-utils providing both the bzloop
  and {create,extract}_bzfs executables (http://www.linuxminicd.org/bzloop/)
- Test for both the mkisofs and create_{compressed_,bz}fs executables before
  using them in mklivecd
- Test that the user indeed has root privledges in mklivecd before trying
  to execure
- Display the "short GPL" in "mklivecd --version"
- If an unknown option is specified (-*) in klivecd, complain
- If a target iso is not specified in mklivecd, display the usage info
- Redirect all error messages in mklivecd to stderr
- Only cater for devfs in linuxrc, manually created device should be done
  in mklivecd, not "on-the-fly"
- Chmod /tmp 777 in linuxrc to allow all users write access to it
- Updated the README to contain the mailing list information
- Changes mkisofs -r to -R to preserve user settings in mklivecd
- Moved hwdetect initscript out of /etc/init.d into /usr/share/mklivecd/init.d
- Allow hwdetect to be executed from either /usr/sbin (if installed) or
  from the always available /initrd/usr/sbin in /etc/init.d/hwdetect


* Tue, Sep 23, 2003 Jaco Greeff <jaco@linuxminicd.org> 0.5.4
- Added mkisofs to RPM spec (Reported by Tibor Pittich)
- Sync with RPM spec as imported into Mandrake contrib
- Removed locale dependency from initrd size calculation in mklivecd
  (Reported by Tibor Pittich, fix suggested by Buchan Milne)
- Renamed "--root" option to "--rootdir"
- --rootdir option now works as expected (inclusive of --exclude-{file,dir}
  options)
- If the selected kernel doesn't match the running kernel in mklivecd, don't
  try to generate the module dependencies, rather just copy the existing files
  to the correct initrd location
- Added a FAQ entry for creating a very minimal Mandrake LiveCD


* Mon, Sep 22, 2003 Jaco Greeff <jaco@linuxminicd.org> 0.5.3
- hwdetect once again creates a workable (non-optimal) XF86Config file
  allowing X to be started
- Added explicit --kernel option to mklivecd, if not specified it defaults to
  the current running kernel (uname -r)
- Added --exclude-file option to mklivecd
- Exclude the following file patterns by default in the LiveCD image creation
  of mklivecd:
    - core.* (/core[.][0-9][0-9]*$)
    - *.rpmnew (.*[.]rpmnew$)
    - *.rpmsave (.*[.]rpmsave$)
    - /.* (^/[.].*)
    - .bash_history (/[.]bash_history$)
    - .fonts.cache-* (/[.]fonts[.]cache-[0-9]$)
    - .xauth* (/[.]xauth.*)
    - .xsession-errors (/[.]xsession-errors$)
- Changed exclude directory pattern to not assume a full path. i.e. ^ is to be
  added to denote a full path
- Do exact matches on the default excluded directories (leading ^, trailing $)
  to shrink the size of the excluded list, making scanning faster
- Decreased initrd size by removing the extraoneous 250K (not needed anymore)
- Cleaned usage information displayed in mklivecd --help
- If --cloop is not specified on command-line, don't create link in mklivecd
- Try /tmp first before $TMPDIR for a decent tmp directory (/tmp is always
  excluded from the final LiveCD, $TMPDIR might not be)
- linuxrc now creates /var/log/wtmp and /var/run/utmp
- Split project version into major, minor & patch in Makefile
- Fixed uname -r bug in Makefile, allowing for correct execution via shell


* Mon, Sep 15, 2003 Jaco Greeff <jaco@linuxminicd.org> 0.5.2
- Revamped linuxrc and mklivecd to cater for pivot_root, allowing better access
  to actual mounted filesystems


* Mon, Sep 01, 2003 Jaco Greeff <jaco@linuxminicd.org> 0.5.1
- Initial release under the mklivecd name (preparing for a wider release to the
  MDK community) after being adapted from the MiniCD build, init and hwdetect
  scripts
- Added spec file for RPM build
