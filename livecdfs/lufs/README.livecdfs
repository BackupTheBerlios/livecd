This is a very, very minimal version of lufs-0.9.7, just
enough to provide the extra files we need to build livecdfs.

The daemon (lufsd) source code is also provided, this has been
altered slightly to allow the building of a lufsd.livecdfs 
daemon, only utilising the livecdfs filesystem without loading
additional libraries.
