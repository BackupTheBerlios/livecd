LiveCDFS is a UnionFS copy-on-write (COW) implementation on top of the Linux 
User Filesystem (LUFS) to allow for writable CD images.

Usage: 
    mount -t lufs none <mount> -o fs=livecdfs,rw_tmp=<tmp>,ro_root=<root> 
    
    or
    
    lufsd none <mount> -o fs=livecdfs,rw_tmp=<tmp>,ro_root=<root> 

Required Options:
    <mount>            The final mountpoint where the fs is to be visible
    rw_tmp=<tmp>       The writable space (for new files, appends, etc.)
    ro_root=<root>     The read-only root to be visible at <mount>

General Options:
    own_fs             The executing user owns the filesystem
    fmask=<mask>       The minimal permissions for files
    dmask=<mask>       The minimal permissions for directories              
    uid=<id>           The user id to own the filesystem
    gid=<id>           The group id to own the filesystem
