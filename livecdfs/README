LiveCDFS is a UnionFS copy-on-write (COW) implementation on top of the 
Linux User Filesystem (LUFS) to allow for writable CD images.

The latest stable version of the package can alway be found at
the following URL:

    http://livecd.berlios.de

If you want to contibute, or just fancy running the latest-
greatest version, you can also get the latest development version
from CVS:

    export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.livecd.berlios.de:/cvsroot/livecd
    cvs login (There is no anonymous password, a simple Enter will do)
    cvs -z3 co livecdfs

If you have been granted developer access to the project, you can
access CVS with the following commands:

    export CVS_RSH=ssh
    export CVSROOT=:ext:USERNAME@cvs.livecd.berlios.de:/cvsroot/livecd
    cvs -z3 co livecdfs

There is a mailing list available for discussion of the livecd scripts
and their associated programs (including LiveCDFS). More information on 
this list, including subscription details can be found at:

    http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/livecd-users
    http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/livecd-devel

Patches, suggestions, flames and general comments are always
welcome at the above adress. Good luck!
