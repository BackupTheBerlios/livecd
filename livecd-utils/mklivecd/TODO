- Add profiles to allow for build of various types of CD's, eg.
  minicd
- Cleanup of mklivecd script (some functions exists, creation of
  initrd is a good candidate)
- Localisation support
- Remove functions in hwdetect where we have duplicated already
  existing MDK functions, e.g. in module loading
- Cleanup function duplication in rc.sysinit and linuxrc. Done to
  get rc.sysinit there quickly, these should move into a library
  for re-use/source, even in halt.local
